=== Introduction ===

Here's what you need to know about the distribution...

=== Details ===

  * I had to rip out the MGC proprietary code.  Nothing big.  Stuff like server names, network paths, etc.  You would have had to change it yourself anyway.  Start with src/cqsvrvars.pm, read the admin docs and look over the code for obvious hard-coded values.
  * One of the admin documents, 'Synopsis: Logs' is not complete yet.  It just got dropped in lieu of getting the source uploaded and published.  Don't worry, I'll get to it.
  * The admin doc 'Logging-in to the CQ/XML Server' was intentionally removed from the public distribution.
